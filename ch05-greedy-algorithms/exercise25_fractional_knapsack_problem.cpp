/*
The Knapsack Problem
Suppose you are given a set of objects, O = {O1, O2, â€¦, On}, with each having a certain
weight, Wi, and a value of Vi. You are also given a bag (or a knapsack) that can carry only
a total weight of T units. Now, say you are tasked with finding out about a set of objects
to keep in your bag so that the total weight is less than or equal to T, and the total value
of the objects is the maximum it can possibly be.
A real-world example of this problem can be understood if you imagine a traveling
trader who earns a fixed percentage profit on all their trades. They would want to carry
the maximum value of goods to maximize their profit, but their vehicle (or knapsack)
can hold only up to T units of weight. The trader knows the exact weight and value of
each object. Which set of objects should they carry so that the total value of the objects
carried for trade is the maximum possible?

The Fractional Knapsack Problem
Now, we will make a small change to the knapsack problem that was given in the
previous subsection: let's say we are now allowed to break each object into as many
parts as we need, and then we can choose what fraction of each object we want to keep
in the knapsack.
In terms of the real-world analogy, let's say that the trader in our previous analogy is
trading items such as oil, grains, and flour. The trader may take any smaller measure of
weight.
Contrary to the NP-completeness of the standard knapsack, the fractional knapsack
problem has a simple solution: order the elements according to their value per weight
ratio and 'greedily' choose as many objects as possible with the maximum ratio.
The following figure shows the optimal selection of a given set of objects when the
knapsack's capacity is set to 8 units. Notice that the chosen objects are the ones with
the highest value per weight ratio.
